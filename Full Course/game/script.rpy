    "At least the grounds look pretty amazing. A good amount of different interesting buildings with some older more traditional style buildings and some non typical sleek designs. I wonder which one they hold the cooking classes in!"

    "Let's just get this over with. Ugh why can’t I just go to the cooking building and be done already."
    
    "Their campus is some kind of hodgepodge of buildings. Some of them are almost falling apart, and some that were just built. They make it really confusing to try to commit them all to memory."
    
    "Why would they try to get you to remember so many names and locations for buildings, AND THEN make you learn everything required for the classes you have to take."
    
    "It’s just a whole lot to try to keep in your head, how am I supposed to concentrate on not messing up these first impressions with all of the new people I meet!"
    
    "Wait... where am I?"
    
    "I think I lost my group."
    
    "Er, everybody else was in cooking together too, right? This was a tour for cooking students..."

    "Oh, this must be one of the high schoolers with the tour. They have some pretty neat uniforms. He’s rather slim as well, probably stays pretty darn busy."
    
    "Most private schools around here are cheap and just have you dress up, they hardly even care what color."
    
    Morgan "Yeah, I just got a bit lost."
    
    Morgan "But, I found my way here after all, so it’s all good."
    
    Morgan "This place is great. I mean, look at all this stuff they’ve got. I don’t know if I’ve seen cooking equipment this good in my life."

    Morgan "She always gives him this glares when he says it."

    Morgan "It wasn’t so much to a cat as it was around a cat. A lot of cats."
    
    Morgan "And, I don’t think he actually did anything. It’s probably a lie, or an extreme over-exaggeration..."
    
    Morgan "At least I really hope it is..."
    
    Morgan "But anyway, have you ever seen a mixer this big? You could probably mix, like, a person in that thing! Shoot, maybe two people."
    
    Morgan "Ha, mixing people, that’s kinda dirty. Though I guess that mixing up any number of people would be dirty, now that I think about it. Or mixing anything really."

    Alexandra "Uhuh. haha."
    
    Morgan "Mixers really are messy devices, no matter what you mix. It’s in their nature."
    
    Morgan "Still, I think I love this room. And to think, there’s probably a dozen more."
    
    Morgan "Filled to the brim with flippers, floppers, and so many knives. Well, hopefully there are knives."
    
    Morgan "I mean, I know it’s school so I would understand if they laid off the knives, but that would be such a disappointment. Knives are important, for any kitchen."
    
    Alexandra "Well, if you’re done ranting about dirty mixers and knives, we really should get you back to the tour."

    "No, that is not what puppies say. Maybe there’s something in the language of flowers for this..."

    "That’s it, flowers! That’s what dad always gets mom when he screws up."
