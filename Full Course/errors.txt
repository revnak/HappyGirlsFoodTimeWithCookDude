    OH MY, I see what you mean, well maybe we have something back home you don’t have in your kitchen!
    
    
    
    MORGAN (V.O.):
    I think I’ll just gonna be going now jobs done.
    
    NIKOLAUS:
    Wait where are you going chef? I haven’t properly thanked you!
    
    MORGAN:
    No that’s fine just doing my job really.
    
    *HUG*
    
    MORGAN (V.O.):
    Grip tight. Oxygen. Need oxygen.
    
    MORGAN:
    I CAN’T BREATHE!
    
    NIKOLAUS:
    Well i’m very sorry sometimes I don’t realize my own strength but I am very grateful that you went out of your way to make specialty meal for me! [sparkles if we have them]
    
    [nick sprite]
    
    MORGAN:
    Yeah meathead it was no problem, my boss was gonna get angry at me and I would really enjoy working here, but that might end soon I don’t know.

    MORGAN: 
    Ugh!
    
    NIKOLAUS: 
    I am very sorry, is there any way I could help?
    
    MORGAN: 
    I don’t know, do you have an apartment that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg?
    
    NIKOLAUS: 
    Well, yes. Yes I do. I’ve been looking for a roommate, but everyone keeps turning me down. It’s for an apartment designated for international students, so it’s actually rather inexpensive.
    
    MORGAN: 
    That was rhetorical. I mean, I appreciate it, but I don’t think it will be enough.
    
    NIKOLAUS: 
    Also you can work somewhere else? You sure seem to be a very good cook. The first two plates I had were delicious, though I would have preferred some more proud traditional-
    
    MORGAN: 
    You ate two plates? You ate two whole plates of food and then came into the back complain to both chefs about the menu?
    
    NIKOLAUS: 
    Food was very good. A bit light for my tastes, but very good!
    
    MORGAN: 
    Well, that’s not enough I guess. I’m too ignorant of cooking terms, at least that’s what my mom told me she’s going to throw her own child out to fend for himself.
    
    NIKOLAUS: 
    What kind of mother would do such a thing?
    
    MORGAN: 
    Exactly what I’ve been thinking! And all because I don’t know what a spatula is!
    
    NIKOLAUS: 
    Spatula?
    
    MORGAN: 
    Exactly! Who knows what a spatula is.
    
    NICK: 
    No, I’m sorry, I think you misunderstand, I was surprised you did not know. It is a very simple thing.
    
    MORGAN: 
    Oh. Well, the short of it is that in a few weeks I’ll be out of my house and might be out of a job to start college.
    
    NICK: 
    OH is that what it is, you can probably do both! And move in with me! University has many courses of study. I think there is a cooking school. You could learn what a spatula is, or other things too!
    
    MC: You know, that sounds like a plan. What’s your name?
    
    NICK: 
    NICHOLAS. And you?
    
    MORGAN: 
    Morgan. I think this may be a great opportunity for me. I’m not much of a school guy, but maybe this could work out. My dad always talked about how much he enjoyed cooking school. 
    
    NICK: 
    Your father also cooks?
    
    MORGAN: 
    Yeah.
    
    NICK: 
    Hmm, so he must know what a spatula is then. Your mother has not kicked him out yet.
    
    MORGAN: 
    Yeah totally... *cough*
    
    5 ARIA INTRO? Also new job
    MORGAN (V.O.): 
    Well, today could have gone better. Definitely better, this is just so many dishes how do we have so many dishes! I’m not sure if it could have gone worse. I mean, even if something bizarre had happened, like if I lost my pants or something, I would have just left at that point. 
    
    Δ1: Being put on dishwasher duty kinda sucks but only working so many hours will leave time for class work. At least, that’s what dad has been telling me. Didn’t think he ever had to start as a dishwasher, he’s such a good cook.
    
    Δ2: Ugh this is so fucking stupid. There is no way that did was a dishwasher, ever. Bullshit. Now I’m stuck getting all gross and pruney hands. 
    
    
    Julie: 
    Morgan, stop daydreaming and hurry up with those dishes already, you’re getting behind.
    
    MORGAN: 
    Hey, I just got most of these alright.
    
    Julie: 
    Well I’ve got two big reservations leaving soon so after you get all of their dishes done I’m going to need your help moving tables around for Karaoke night.
    
    MORGAN: 
    Fine.
    
    MORGAN (V.O.): 
    Work... is work I guess. I just don’t feel like it’s worth the effort really. But I need the money. Even if I have to be put to work part time as a dishwasher.
    
    MORGAN (V.O.)
    And I’m gonna have to move again, ugh. I moving is always the worst, you leave all memories and everything familiar, but I just can’t stay, so yeah...
    
    [ding noise]
    
    ...the dishes are done. Well, I guess I should get to moving those tables around.

    Julie: 
    You just think she’s hot don’t you?
    
    MORGAN:
    Well, I can barely see her.
    
    Julie: 
    She can barely say a word let alone a sentence and you think that she’s singing well?
    
    MORGAN: 
    Putting a sentence together isn’t the only point of singing, sometimes you’re just trying to express a feeling or something.
    
    Julie: 
    The feeling of intense queeziness brought about by one too many cocktails? Or five.
    
    MORGAN: 
    Well, there are other feelings there too. I just can’t put my finger on them.
    
    Julie: 
    I think you’re just trying to start a fight for no reason again.
    
    MORGAN: 
    I think you’re getting too good at this. Alright, I’m taking off. Have fun with the rest of tonight’s drunks.
    
    Julie: 
    I’ll try. No guarantees but I’ll certainly try.

    JULIE:
    I don’t know, but she does come in pretty regularly.
    
    ROB:
    Yeah I always try to put in a little extra for her but she never leaves very high tips. I don’t know if she’s just stingy with her money or what?

    MORGAN(V.O.):
    There’s a cute girl calling me over to her table?
    
    MORGAN:
    Hello, I am Morgan, I was told that you wanted to see me?
    
    DIANA:
    Yeah. Although I can’t say I’m very impressed. When I asked to see the cook I expected a more  well-groomed adult.

    So... Did I fuck up? That was faster than I thought it would take.

    My heart feels like it’s about to burst out of my chest, she has such pretty--

    Wait, she wants me to come work for her? I can’t do that, that would mean I would have to (A-:leave this place.) (A+:put off school.)

    I... I’m sorry but I can’t do that.

    There are- wait, are you for real?
    
    DIANA:
    I just can’t believe that you’d rather keep your part time job over- you know what how much to get you out of this place is so beneath your skill?
    
    
    MORGAN:
    Oh no, I get paid plenty here. I mean not enough to pay rent but it’s all covered everything, it’s fine, I don’t need extra money.

    MORGAN: 
    uh, no. i don’t go out much.

    not really.

    Uh-huh.
    
    Dave: 
    Well I’m a mechanic, work on cars. Last week, we had this ‘67 Impala come through the shop. Man, I’d give a leg to drive that, though I probably wouldn’t be able to without the leg haha.

    Gotta give myself a little breather before I have to head off to the campus, this coffee shop is tucked away enough that it doesn’t get too many customers. Taking my breaks from work and school here will be some of the best parts of my day. Taking my breaks from Nick here are some of the best parts of my week.

    Neither do I honestly, but he says it all the time. I think it’s some kind of to be a joke about my mom. She always gives him this glares when he says it. Then again, she always glares at him. Between that and the cat story I guess she has a point.

    It wasn’t so much to a cat as it was around a cat. A lot of cats. And I don’t think he actually did anything. It’s probably a lie, or an extreme over exaggeration... At least I really hope it is. But anyway, have you even seen a mixer this big? You could probably mix, like, a person in that thing! Shoot, maybe two people.

    Mixers really are messy devices, no matter what you mix. It’s in their nature. Still, I think I love this room. And to think, there’s probably a dozen more of them. Filled to the brim with flippers, floppers, and so many knives. Well, hopefully there are knives. I mean, I know it’s school so I would understand if they laid off the knives, but that would be a disappointment. Knives are important, for any kitchen.
